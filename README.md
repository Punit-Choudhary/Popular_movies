# Popular_movies
Movies are integral part of our life. We love to watch movies but it is very hard to find out good movies from the world cinema.

TMDB.org is a crowd-sourced movie information database used by many film-related consoles, sites and apps, such as XBMC, MythTV and Plex. Dozens of media managers, mobile apps and 
social sites make use of its API.

TMDb lists some 80,000 films at time of writing, which is considerably fewer than IMDb.
While not as complete as IMDb, it holds extensive information for most popular/Hollywood films.

This is dataset of the 10,000 most popular movies across the world has been fetched through the read API.
TMDB's free API provides for developers and their team to programmatically fetch and use TMDb's data.
Their API is to use as long as you attribute TMDb as the source of the data and/or images. Also, they update their API from time to time.

This data set is fetched using exception handling process so the data set contains some null values as there are missing fields in the tmdb database.
Thought it's good for a young analyst to deal with messing value.

In this project I analysed the same dataset using Python Pandas on windows machine but the project can be run on any machine that supports Python and Pandas.
Besides pandas I've also used matplotlib python module for visualization of this dataset.

The whole project is divided into four major parts i.e.
* reading
* analysis
* visualization
* export <br/>

All these part are further divided into menus for easy navigation.
